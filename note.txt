I'm running RhoLoss with the reweighting and am noticing that the there is usually one or two points that really outweigh the rest (a single data point having a weight of 0.6) 
with the rest of the data nearly split equally. I added in a projection feature, but it's a little hard to fine tune it. Typically the projection ends up putting as much weight as possible
on the single data point and splitting everything else evenly (see projection4 logs). Might need to fine tune the emphasis placed on the reducible loss.
